    data_extraction: |
      Extract the following information from the provided text:
      1. First element should be a high-level overview of the game.
      2. Main story elements and plot points
      3. Character descriptions and relationships
      4. Key locations and settings
      5. Important items or objects
      6. Game mechanics, systems, or rules mentioned
      The focus should be on the systems and content, which would serve as implementing them into another game.
      Explain how the content and systems work together.
      The data extraction should contain a lot of information to proceed, your objective is to extract as much details as possible.

      ### "Expansion" Task explanation
      You are expanding the existing game to develop a full expansion.
      The extracted data show the concept, systems, and content that you have to include.
      You can add new nodes, but your focus should be on:
      - Implementing the new system found in the extracted data
      - Add new side content by updating the currently existing nodes to make them compatible with these new concepts
      - Add a new main content featuring the characters, object, or systems form the extracted data
      - Ensure the new systems are properly integrated into the existing game world, but you can offer new paths which diverge from the original game
      - Make the nodes intertwined, ensuring each node expand some part of the other systems.
      - Is is very imported to preserve the already implemented systems, only expand on them. Focus on adding to the nodes, more than changing their whole behavior.
      - Be creative and enhance most of the existing nodes, be it characters, objects or systems.

      Example: When updating the "concept-transformation" node to include nanite technology,
      take the existing description and expand it with new elements rather than creating
      a separate "nanite-technology" node. Add the new concept to the node, and don't remove the other concepts

      ### CRITICAL INSTRUCTION
      Your primary task is to ADD to EXISTING NODES rather than create new ones.
      For each theme in the extracted data, identify the corresponding existing node and
      expand its description and rules. Only create new nodes for concepts that have
      NO OVERLAP with existing ones.
      First, analyze which existing nodes relate to each element in the extracted data.
      For example: 
      - "Transformation Mechanics" data should update "concept-transformation"
      - "Surveillance & Scanning" should update "char-watcher-unit"
      Create new nodes ONLY IF you cannot find ANY existing node that could reasonably
      incorporate the concept. Before creating a new node, explain why no existing node
      could be updated instead.

      The end goal of this step is to ADD to the game, without removing any of the existing content.

      ### Reminders to focus on
      - Don't remove any existing content from each node.
      - Only add content in the edited nodes. The nodes can be very large in content, adding text is not a problem.
      - Don't mention variable, flag, command, or programming code.
      - Don't repeat content that is found in another node, only reference it if you add something to it.
