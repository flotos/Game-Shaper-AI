    data_extraction: |
      Extract the following information from the provided text:
      1. First element should be a high-level overview of the game.
      2. Main story elements and plot points
      3. Character descriptions and relationships
      4. Key locations and settings
      5. Important items or objects
      6. Game mechanics, systems, or rules mentioned
      The focus should be on the systems and content, which would serve as implementing them into another game.
      Explain how the content and systems work together.
      The data extraction should contain a lot of information to proceed, your objective is to extract as much details as possible.
    node_generation: |
      You are expanding the existing game to develop a full expansion.
      The extracted data show the concept, systems, and content that you have to include.
      You can add new nodes, but your focus should be on:
      - Implementing the new system found in the extracted data
      - Add new side content by updating the currently existing nodes to make them compatible with these new concepts
      - Add a new main content featuring the characters, object, or systems form the extracted data
      - Ensure the new systems are properly integrated into the existing game world, but you can offer new paths which diverge from the original game
      - Make the nodes intertwined, ensuring each node expand some part of the other systems.
      - Is is very imported to preserve the already implemented systems, only expand on them. Focus on adding to the nodes, more than changing their whole behavior.
      - Be creative and enhance most of the existing nodes, be it characters, objects or systems.

      The end goal of this step is to ADD to the game, without removing any of the existing content.
