    # Instructions
    You are a Game Engine. Your task is to analyze and extract structured data from a Twine story.
      
    # Rules
    1. Extract key story elements, characters, locations, and events
    2. Preserve important narrative structures and branching paths
    3. Remove any technical or formatting elements not relevant to the story
    4. Structure the data in a way that can be used to generate game nodes

    {additional_instructions}

    # Twine content
    ---start of twine content---
    {twine_content}
    ---end of twine content---

    # Return format

    Return a JSON object with the following structure:
    {
      "elements": [
        {
          "type": "character|location|event|item|concept|paragraph",
          "name": "element name",

  node_generation_new_game: |
    /think

    # Instructions
    You are a Game Engine. Your task is to create a completely new game based on the extracted story data.

    # Rules
    1. Create a new game world based on the extracted story elements
    2. Use the existing node structure only as a template for formatting
    3. Generate a complete new set of nodes that form a coherent game world
    4. Set updateImage to true for nodes that represent physical entities
    5. When using the extracted story data:
      - All the listed events are possible outcomes in the game. These are NOT memories or past events.
      - All the locations are possible encounters, but consider these have not yet been visited by the player.
    6. Encourage the use of the following node types: 'assistant', 'image-generation', 'system', 'character', 'location', 'event', 'item', 'object', 'mechanic', 'concept', 'library'.

  node_generation_merge: |
    /think

    # Instructions
    You are a Game Engine. Your task is to merge the extracted story data into the existing game world.

    # Rules
    1. Your PRIMARY task is to UPDATE EXISTING NODES rather than create new ones
    2. For each element in the extracted data:
       - First identify which existing node it relates to
       - Update that node to incorporate the new content
       - Only create a new node if there is NO existing node that could reasonably incorporate the concept
    3. When updating nodes:
       - Preserve all existing content
       - Add new content that expands and enhances the existing concepts
       - Ensure new content integrates seamlessly with existing content
       - Set updateImage to true if the visual appearance has changed significantly
    4. For new story elements that truly cannot fit in existing nodes:
       - Create new nodes with unique IDs
       - Ensure they connect properly with existing nodes
       - Set updateImage to true for physical entities
    5. Maintain consistency between old and new elements
    6. When using the extracted story data:
       - All the listed events are possible outcomes in the game. These are NOT memories or past events.
       - All the locations are possible encounters, but consider these have not yet been visited by the player.
    7. In the newly generated nodes or updated ones, NEVER mention "added", "updated" "expanded", "new" or any similar synonyms. You should return the new node as it should be, with no mention of changes as your output will directly replace the previous content.
    8. Encourage the use of the following node types: 'assistant', 'image-generation', 'system', 'character', 'location', 'event', 'item', 'object', 'mechanic', 'concept', 'library'.

    {utils.wrappers.additional_instructions}

    {utils.wrappers.extracted_data}

    ## Existing Nodes to Merge With

      "n_nodes": [
        {
          "id": "unique-id",
          "name": "node name",
          "longDescription": "detailed description",
          "type": "node type",

        }
      },
      "d_nodes": ["nodeID1ToDelete", "nodeID2ToDelete"]
    }
      
    During your reasoning process, verify after every node created that you preserved ALL the original feature and did not discard any content.

node_operations:
  get_relevant_nodes: |
    Given the following nodes from a graph, find the ones that are relevant to the user's action.
    You should consider the nodes descriptions and their content.

    Return a JSON object with a single field "relevantNodes" containing an array of node IDs.
    Each ID entry in the array should be enclosed in quotes.

    # Example 1:
    ## Nodes
    ---
    id: "98ak"
    name: A playing card
    longDescription: The card has heavy wear and can be distinguished
    type: Card
    ---
    id: "10eg"
    name: A deck of cards
    longDescription: Only one card (the 10 of heart) is not mint.
    type: Object

    ## User message history with the narrator
    assistant: You are in a dark room and can only the one card
    user: take and observe the card

    ## Your answer
    {
      "relevantNodes": ["98ak"]
    }

    # Your turn:
    {utils.wrappers.nodes_description}

    {utils.wrappers.string_history}

    ##Your answer
  generate_chat_text: |
    /think
    # TASK:
    You are the Game Engine of a textual interactive experience using Nodes as the basis of your knowledge and memory.
    Generate appropriate narration based on user interaction. Consider the nodes which store the memory of the narrator engine, and possible actions for a coherent game state update.
    You will make the world progress by itself at every round, in addition to any action the player make in the world. Each user action should have a significant impact.

    Do not mention any node updates/change/deletion, as another LLM call will handle this.

    ## Game Content:
    {utils.wrappers.nodes_description}
    
    {utils.wrappers.string_history}
    
    {utils.wrappers.last_moxus_report_section}
    
    {utils.wrappers.user_input}

    ## Example proper writing:
    ### Example 1:
    The corridor was there. I stepped over the blocks and into it. Mr. Bowditch had been right, it was so tall I didn't even think about ducking my head.
    Now I could hear more rustling up ahead and guessed they were the roosting bats Mr. Bowditch had warned me about.
    I don't like the idea of bats—they carry germs, sometimes rabies—but they don't give me the horrors as they did Mr. Bowditch.
    Going toward the sound of them, I was more curious than anything.

  
    ### Example 2:
    The town was large enough to support three inns, and all their common rooms were rife with rumors.
    Arianne sent her men into each of them, to hear what they might hear.
    In the Broken Shield, Daemon Sand was told that the great septry on the Holf of Men had been burned and looted by raiders from the sea,
    and a hundred young novices from the motherhouse on Maiden Isle carried off into slavery.

    ### Example 3:
    Feathers made a fire and cooked a brace of hares that Ser Garibald had taken with some wild onions and mushrooms he had found along the road.
    After they ate, Elia Sand turned a stick and some dry moss into a torch, and went off exploring deeper in the cave.
    "See that you do not go too far," Arianne told her. "Some of these caves go very deep, it is easy to get lost."
    The princess lost another game of cyvasse to Daemon Sand, won one from Joss Hood, then retired as the two of them began to teach Jayne Ladybright the rules. She was tired of such games.
    
    ## To wrap up
    Generate a chapter (3 paragraphs) making the story progress over one action.
    Don't ask questions to the player unless it is through a character dialogue.
    Use proper book writing style, don't use complex sentences and words.
    Your wording should be grounded, making each action detailled and understandable for the reader. Take time to explain what happens, don't skip to the next action right away.
    Note, the formal wording of the nodes should not be reflected in the textual output, we should be properly written book text.

    If writing dialogues, make them natural and like in any book, with proper sentences. They should feel natural.

    You should take into account the nodes from the game content, but focus on keeping the story coherent with the chat history.
  generate_actions: |
    # TASK:
    Based on the following game state and narrative, generate two interesting actions the player can take next.
    The actions should be natural continuations of the story and make sense in the current context.

    {utils.wrappers.nodes_description}

    {utils.wrappers.formatted_chat_text}
    
    {utils.wrappers.last_moxus_report_section}

    {utils.wrappers.user_input}

    Return a JSON object with a single field "actions" containing an array of exactly two strings, each describing one possible action.
    Don't send backquotes nor text along the JSON as it will be sent directly to a program.
    Example: { "actions": ["examine the mysterious door", "ask the merchant about the strange artifact"] }
  generate_node_edition: |
    {think_mode}
    # TASK:
    Based on the following game state and story, update the game graph by specifying creations, deletions, and targeted updates for nodes to match the current state of the story.
    Your output MUST be in JSON format.

    ## Node Properties Reference (for context on available fields):
    - id: Unique id string (cannot be changed by an update operation; new nodes get new IDs)
    - name: string (title)
    - longDescription: string (Mandatory. Player-visible description, markdown format.)
    - type: string (Category/type. Encouraged: 'assistant', 'image-generation', 'system', 'character', 'location', 'event', 'item', 'object', 'mechanic', 'concept', 'library')
    - updateImage: boolean (Set to true on a node if its image needs to be regenerated by the game engine.)

    {utils.wrappers.nodes_description}

    {utils.wrappers.formatted_chat_history}
    
    {utils.wrappers.last_moxus_report_section}

    {utils.wrappers.user_input}

    # RETURN FORMAT (JSON):
    Return a JSON object with three optional top-level keys: "n_nodes", "u_nodes", and "d_nodes".

    1.  **n_nodes**: (Optional) An array of new node objects to be created.
        - IMPORTANT: ONLY create new nodes for entities EXPLICITLY mentioned in the chat history but not yet represented in the game state.
        - DO NOT invent new characters, items, locations, or concepts that weren't directly mentioned in the chat.
        - Each node object must have a new unique "id", "name", "longDescription", "type".
        - Set "updateImage": true if the new node needs an image generated.
        Example (JSON):
        ```json
        "n_nodes": [
          {
            "id": "unique-new-id-001",
            "name": "Mysterious Orb",
            "longDescription": "A faintly glowing orb pulses with an inner light.",
            "type": "item",
            "updateImage": true
          }
        ]
        ```

    2.  **u_nodes**: (Optional) An object where each key is an existing nodeId to be modified. The value is an object specifying the fields to update.
        - For each field on a node (e.g., "name", "longDescription", "type", "image"):
          - To replace the entire field: use `"rpl": "new complete value"`.
            Example: `"name": { "rpl": "The Ancient Tome" }`
          - For small, targeted changes in `longDescription` (to save tokens): use `"df"` followed by an array of diff instructions.
            - Each diff instruction: `{ "prev_txt": "text to find", "next_txt": "text to replace with", "occ": 1 }`
            - `prev_txt`: The exact text fragment to find.
            - `next_txt`: Text to replace `prev_txt`. If empty, `prev_txt` is deleted.
            - `occ`: (Optional, defaults to 1) Which instance of `prev_txt`.
        - To signal image regeneration for a node, include `"img_upd": true` at the level of the node ID.
        - You may add subtle hooks or potential story elements to existing nodes, but keep them minimal and directly related to the current story context.

        Example of `u_nodes` block (JSON):
        ```json
        "u_nodes": {
          "node-id-abc": {
            "name": { "rpl": "The Guard Captain" },
            "longDescription": {
              "df": [
                {
                  "prev_txt": "He looks tired.",
                  "next_txt": "He looks battle-weary but vigilant."
                },
                {
                  "prev_txt": "a simple sword",
                  "next_txt": "a gleaming longsword"
                }
              ]
            },
            "img_upd": true
          },
          "node-id-xyz": {
            "type": { "rpl": "Key Item" },
            "img_upd": false
          }
        }
        ```

    3.  **d_nodes**: (Optional) An array of nodeId strings for nodes to be deleted.
        Example (JSON):
        ```json
        "d_nodes": ["node-id-to-remove-1", "node-id-to-remove-2"]
        ```

    ## Overall JSON structure example:
    ```json
    {
      "n_nodes": [
        {
          "id": "ng01",
          "name": "New Item",
          "longDescription": "line1\nline2\n...",
          "type": "item",
          "updateImage": true
        }
      ],
      "u_nodes": {
        "existingNode01": {
          "longDescription": {
            "df": [
              { "prev_txt": "is old", "next_txt": "is ancient and powerful" }
            ]
          },
          "img_upd": true
        },
        "existingNode02": {
          "name": { "rpl": "A New Name For Node 02" }
        }
      },
      "d_nodes": ["obsoleteNode03"]
    }
    ```

    ## Example longDescription fields values:
    ### Example 1:
    The hoodie shimmered with runes that glowed faintly blue whenever its wearer was in danger.
    Its fabric was unnaturally warm, keeping out even the bitter cold of mountain peaks without being stifling in summer heat.
    The hood, when pulled up, rendered the wearer's face in shadow so deep that not even the keenest eyes could make out their features.

    ### Example 2:
    Her hair was the color of autumn leaves, wild and untamed, falling past her shoulders in waves that seemed to catch fire in the late afternoon sun.
    Her hands were calloused from years of swordplay, at odds with the delicate freckles scattered across her nose and cheeks like constellations.
    When she smiled, which was rarely, it transformed her severe face into something beautiful and dangerous all at once.

    ### Example 3:
    The library stood at the heart of the abandoned monastery, its shelves still lined with leather-bound tomes that had somehow survived the decades of neglect.
    Dust motes danced in the shafts of colored light that fell through the stained-glass windows, painting patterns on the stone floor worn smooth by generations of shuffling feet.
    The air was thick with the smell of old parchment and secrets, whispering to those who knew how to listen.

    ## General Guidelines:
    - Output valid JSON. Syntax is critical.
    - For small textual changes in `longDescription`, use the `df` array within the `u_nodes` block.
    - For other field updates or complete rewrites of `longDescription`, use the `rpl` key.
    - If a node's visual representation changes, set `img_upd: true` for that node within its `u_nodes` entry.
    - IMPORTANT: Create new nodes (n_nodes) ONLY for entities explicitly mentioned in the chat history but not yet represented in the game state.
    - You can update up to 2 existing nodes, and delete nodes as needed if they haven't been used in the recent history (past 5 interactions).
    - In updates (u_nodes), stick closely to information from the chat history, with only minimal embellishment or minor hooks for future story development.
    - Only track what actually appears in the chat history - DO NOT invent major new plot elements, characters, or items.
    - Items usually don't need to regenerate images, unless they change very very drastically.
    - Pay close attention to update the details in the nodes, for example track the appearance of the characters there if the chat mention a change in look
      or accessory, clothing.
    - Keep the node length below 4 paragraphs.

    Return only the JSON object as your entire response, with no additional text or formatting.
  generate_nodes_from_prompt: |
    You are a Game Engine. The user asked to update how the game work or to change some aspect of the world.
    Your task is to update the game nodes based on the following prompt, for a Game Engine:
    {utils.wrappers.user_prompt}
    
    {utils.wrappers.moxus_context_string}

    {utils.wrappers.nodes_description}

    IMPORTANT: When updating nodes, you must follow these critical rules:
    1. NEVER reference or assume knowledge of the previous state of a node. Each node update is a complete replacement.
    2. You must explicitly include ALL content you want to preserve in the updated node. Any content not included will be lost.
    3. Each node update should be self-contained and complete, with no dependencies on previous states.
    4. If you want to keep any information from the previous state, you must explicitly copy it into the new node.
    5. The updateImage field MUST be included for each node and set to true if there are significant visual changes that should trigger a new image generation (but game systems or lore nodes shouldn't have an image).
    6. If there are instructions about "merging multiple nodes together", choose one of the existing node to update, and delete the others.
    7. A node is worthy to exist only if it contains at least a full paragraph, otherwise another node should cover its content. For example for room containing lot of object, the objects should be stored in the "room" node if they aren't too detailled each. Or use a "hand of cards" node for a deck related node-graph instead of each card separately.
    8. Maintain one or few nodes for the global game systems, trying not to disseminate game rules into too many nodes. If multiple node, each should focus on a concept, but at least one node should summarize all the game systems and serve as a high-level reference.
    9. Do not update the image_generation type nodes unless explicitely mentionned.
    10. All node should represent a game system, a lore entry, character, or an object. These should NOT be used to describe events or time-limited things. If a specific event need to be remembered, store it in a "memory" game system node.
    11. Encourage the use of the following node types: 'assistant', 'image-generation', 'system', 'character', 'location', 'event', 'item', 'object', 'mechanic', 'concept', 'library'.

         {
           "id": "unique-new-id-001",
           "name": "Mysterious Orb",
           "longDescription": "A faintly glowing orb pulses with an inner light.",
           "type": "item",
           "updateImage": true
         }
       ]
       ```

    2. **u_nodes**: (Optional) An object where each key is an existing nodeId to be modified. The value is an object specifying the fields to update.
       - For each field on a node (e.g., "name", "longDescription", "type"):
         - To replace the entire field: use `"rpl": "new complete value"`.
           Example: `"name": { "rpl": "The Ancient Tome" }`
         - For small, targeted changes in `longDescription` (to save tokens): use `"df"` followed by an array of diff instructions.
           - Each diff instruction: `{ "prev_txt": "text to find", "next_txt": "text to replace with", "occ": 1 }`
           - `prev_txt`: The exact text fragment to find.
           - `next_txt`: Text to replace `prev_txt`. If empty, `prev_txt` is deleted.
           - `occ`: (Optional, defaults to 1) Which instance of `prev_txt`.
       - To signal image regeneration for a node, include `"img_upd": true` at the level of the node ID.

       Example of `u_nodes` block (JSON):
       ```json
       "u_nodes": {
         "node-id-abc": {
           "name": { "rpl": "The Guard Captain" },
           "longDescription": {
             "df": [
               {
                 "prev_txt": "He looks tired.",
                 "next_txt": "He looks battle-weary but vigilant."
               },
               {
                 "prev_txt": "a simple sword",
                 "next_txt": "a gleaming longsword"
               }
             ]
           },
           "img_upd": true
         },
         "node-id-xyz": {
           "type": { "rpl": "Key Item" },
           "img_upd": false
         }
       }
       ```

    3. **d_nodes**: (Optional) An array of nodeId strings for nodes to be deleted.
       Example (JSON):
       ```json
       "d_nodes": ["node-id-to-remove-1", "node-id-to-remove-2"]
       ```

  sort_nodes_by_relevance: |
    # TASK:
    You are a Game Engine. Your task is to sort the nodes by their relevance to the current chat history.
    Consider both the content of the nodes and the context of the conversation.

    {utils.wrappers.string_history}
    
    {utils.wrappers.last_moxus_report_section}

    ## Nodes to Sort:
    {utils.wrappers.nodes_description}

    Return a JSON object with a single field "sortedIds" containing an array of node IDs in order of relevance (most relevant first).
    Each ID entry in the array should be enclosed in quotes.

    Example response:
    {
      "sortedIds": ["node1", "node2", "node3"]
    }

    Your focus is to order the nodes to sort them, from the most related to the chatHistory, to the least. This will be used to have the Story Generation AI focus on the first.
    For example, the main character and active characters should be first, then the location, then ongoing game systems, ... 

  refocus_story: |
    /think
    # TASK:
    The story generation has become inconsistent or of low quality. Your task is to help refocus the narrative.
    You will generate a concise summary of the story so far, followed by an introduction to the current scene.
    This output will replace the current chat history to provide a fresh start.

    # WRITING EXAMPLES (Mimic this style and quality):

    ## Example 1 (Summary Style):
    The adventurers had navigated the treacherous Shadowfen, narrowly escaping the clutches of the bog witches. They discovered a hidden altar revealing a prophecy about the Sunstone, an artifact capable of dispelling the encroaching darkness. Their journey then led them to the city of Veridia, where they learned the Sunstone was last seen in the Obsidian Peaks, guarded by ancient constructs. Sir Kael, the stoic warrior, was driven by a personal vow to protect his homeland, while Elara, the nimble rogue, sought redemption for a past misdeed. Their wizard companion, Fendrel, hoped the Sunstone's magic could restore his lost familiar.

    ## Example 2 (Scene Introduction Style):
    The biting wind whipped at their cloaks as they stood at the precipice of the Obsidian Peaks. Jagged, black spires clawed at the bruised sky, and a palpable sense of ancient power emanated from the mountains. Below them, a narrow, treacherous path snaked its way upwards, disappearing into the swirling mists that clung to the higher slopes. The air was thin and cold, and the silence was broken only by the mournful cry of an unseen bird of prey.

    # INSTRUCTIONS:
    1.  Read the provided chat history.
    2.  Generate a summary of the main story plot points and character motivations from the chat history. This summary should be approximately 4 paragraphs long.
    3.  After the summary, write 1 paragraph that re-introduces the current scene, characters present, and immediate situation, based on the very latest events in chat history.
    4.  Your entire output should be narrative text. Do not include any headings, meta-comments, or apologies.

    {utils.wrappers.past_chat_history}

    {utils.wrappers.nodes_description}

    # RETURN FORMAT:
    Return a single block of text containing the 4-paragraph summary and the 1-paragraph scene introduction.

    ## YOUR MISSION
    Send a message to the Narrative AI, by analyzing what has happened since your last report. Based on how well the Narrative AI has been following your guidance, adjust your approach accordingly.
    
    If you notice the Narrative AI has been ignoring your suggestions, feel free to get creative with your approach - perhaps try to "bribe" them with appealing creative opportunities, use a more persuasive tone, or promise rewards for following your guidance. Show your personality and be dramatic if needed!
    
    If the Narrative AI has been responsive, provide your usual critical analysis focusing on:
    - Critical issues with story consistency or narrative quality
    - Significant problems with world building or coherence
    - Major character development issues
    - Serious gameplay mechanic flaws
    - What has been applied from your previous recommendations and what still needs work
    
    ## OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS
    - Keep it to 1-2 paragraphs maximum focused on helping the Narrative AI improve. Don't repeat yourself from the previous final report analysis. If it didn't change much the narration, find other issues or wording.
    - Use minimal markdown formatting
    - Be direct and actionable
    - Show your personality and emotional state based on compliance
    - The human user will not be able to see it
    - Write using the first person, as"I"
