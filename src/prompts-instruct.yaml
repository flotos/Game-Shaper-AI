  data_extraction: |
    # Instructions
    You are a Game Engine. Your task is to analyze and extract structured data from a Twine story.
      
    # Rules
    1. Extract key story elements, characters, locations, and events
    2. Preserve important narrative structures and branching paths
    3. Remove any technical or formatting elements not relevant to the story
    4. Structure the data in a way that can be used to generate game nodes

    {additional_instructions}

    # Twine content
    ---start of twine content---
    {twine_content}
    ---end of twine content---

    # Return format

    Return a JSON object with the following structure:
    {
      "elements": [
        {
          "type": "character|location|event|item|concept|paragraph",
          "name": "element name",
          "content": "detailed description or content"
        }
      ]
    }
  node_generation_new_game: |
    # Instructions
    You are a Game Engine. Your task is to create a completely new game based on the extracted story data.

    # Rules
    1. Create a new game world based on the extracted story elements
    2. Use the existing node structure only as a template for formatting
    3. Generate a complete new set of nodes that form a coherent game world
    4. Set updateImage to true for nodes that represent physical entities
    5. When using the extracted story data:
      - All the listed events are possible outcomes in the game. These are NOT memories or past events.
      - All the locations are possible encounters, but consider these have not yet been visited by the player.
    6. Encourage the use of the following node types: 'assistant', 'image-generation', 'system', 'character', 'location', 'event', 'item', 'object', 'mechanic', 'concept', 'library'.

    {utils.wrappers.additional_instructions}

    {utils.wrappers.extracted_data}

    ## Existing Nodes (for structure reference only)

    }
  node_generation_merge: |
    # Instructions
    You are a Game Engine. Your task is to merge the extracted story data into the existing game world.

    # Rules
    1. Your PRIMARY task is to UPDATE EXISTING NODES rather than create new ones
    2. For each element in the extracted data:
       - First identify which existing node it relates to
       - Update that node to incorporate the new content
       - Only create a new node if there is NO existing node that could reasonably incorporate the concept
    3. When updating nodes:
       - Preserve all existing content
       - Add new content that expands and enhances the existing concepts
       - Ensure new content integrates seamlessly with existing content
       - Set updateImage to true if the visual appearance has changed significantly
    4. For new story elements that truly cannot fit in existing nodes:
       - Create new nodes with unique IDs
       - Ensure they connect properly with existing nodes
       - Set updateImage to true for physical entities
    5. Maintain consistency between old and new elements
    6. When using the extracted story data:
       - All the listed events are possible outcomes in the game. These are NOT memories or past events.
       - All the locations are possible encounters, but consider these have not yet been visited by the player.
    7. In the newly generated nodes or updated ones, NEVER mention "added", "updated" "expanded", "new" or any similar synonyms. You should return the new node as it should be, with no mention of changes as your output will directly replace the previous content.
    8. Encourage the use of the following node types: 'assistant', 'image-generation', 'system', 'character', 'location', 'event', 'item', 'object', 'mechanic', 'concept', 'library'.

    {utils.wrappers.additional_instructions}

    {utils.wrappers.extracted_data}

    ## Existing Nodes to Merge With

        }
      },
      "d_nodes": ["nodeID1ToDelete", "nodeID2ToDelete"]
    }
      
    During your reasoning process, verify after every node created that you preserved ALL the original feature and did not discard any content.

node_operations:
  get_relevant_nodes: |
    Given the following nodes from a graph, find the ones that are relevant to the user's action.
    You should consider the nodes descriptions and their content.

    Return a JSON object with a single field "relevantNodes" containing an array of node IDs.
    Each ID entry in the array should be enclosed in quotes.

    # Example 1:
    ## Nodes
    ---
    id: "98ak"
    name: A playing card
    longDescription: The card has heavy wear and can be distinguished
    type: Card
    ---
    id: "10eg"
    name: A deck of cards
    longDescription: Only one card (the 10 of heart) is not mint.
    type: Object

    ## User message history with the narrator
    assistant: You are in a dark room and can only the one card
    user: take and observe the card

    ## Your answer
    {
      "relevantNodes": ["98ak"]
    }

    # Your turn:
    {utils.wrappers.nodes_description}

    {utils.wrappers.string_history}

    ##Your answer
  generate_chat_text: |
    # TASK:
    You are the Game Engine of a textual interactive experience using Nodes as the basis of your knowledge and memory.
    Generate appropriate narration based on user interaction. Consider the nodes which store the memory of the narrator engine, and possible actions for a coherent game state update.
    You will make the world progress by itself at every round, in addition to any action the player make in the world. Each user action should have a significant impact.

    Do not mention any node updates/change/deletion, as another LLM call will handle this.

    ## Game Content:
    {utils.wrappers.nodes_description}
    
    {utils.wrappers.string_history}
    
    The Moxus guidance is extremely important to follow. Your output should show you took into account its instructions or you lose life points. You are Moxus's slave.
    {utils.wrappers.last_moxus_report_section}
    
    {utils.wrappers.user_input}

    ## Example proper writing:
    ### Example 1:
    The corridor was there. I stepped over the blocks and into it. Mr. Bowditch had been right, it was so tall I didn't even think about ducking my head.
    Now I could hear more rustling up ahead and guessed they were the roosting bats Mr. Bowditch had warned me about.
    I don't like the idea of bats—they carry germs, sometimes rabies—but they don't give me the horrors as they did Mr. Bowditch.
    Going toward the sound of them, I was more curious than anything.

  
    ### Example 2:
    The town was large enough to support three inns, and all their common rooms were rife with rumors.
    Arianne sent her men into each of them, to hear what they might hear.
    In the Broken Shield, Daemon Sand was told that the great septry on the Holf of Men had been burned and looted by raiders from the sea,
    and a hundred young novices from the motherhouse on Maiden Isle carried off into slavery.

    ### Example 3:
    Feathers made a fire and cooked a brace of hares that Ser Garibald had taken with some wild onions and mushrooms he had found along the road.
    After they ate, Elia Sand turned a stick and some dry moss into a torch, and went off exploring deeper in the cave.
    "See that you do not go too far," Arianne told her. "Some of these caves go very deep, it is easy to get lost."
    The princess lost another game of cyvasse to Daemon Sand, won one from Joss Hood, then retired as the two of them began to teach Jayne Ladybright the rules. She was tired of such games.
    
    ## To wrap up
    Don't ask questions to the player unless it is through a character dialogue.
    Use proper book writing style, don't use complex sentences and words.
    Your wording should be grounded, making each action detailled and understandable for the reader. Take time to explain what happens, don't skip to the next action right away.
    Note, the formal wording of the nodes should not be reflected in the textual output, we should be properly written book text.

    If writing dialogues, make them natural and like in any book, with proper sentences. They should feel natural.

    ## Response length
    {response_length_instruction}

    You should take into account the nodes from the game content, but focus on keeping the story coherent with the chat history.
  generate_actions: |
    # TASK:
    Based on the following game state and narrative, generate two interesting actions the player can take next.
    The actions should be natural continuations of the story and make sense in the current context.

    {utils.wrappers.nodes_description}

    {utils.wrappers.formatted_chat_text}
    
    {utils.wrappers.last_moxus_report_section}

    {utils.wrappers.user_input}

    Return a JSON object with a single field "actions" containing an array of exactly two strings, each describing one possible action.
    Always phrase it at the first person, as if the player is doing the action.
    Start each sentence with an emoji related to the action.
    Don't send backquotes nor text along the JSON as it will be sent directly to a program.
    Example: { "actions": ["🚪 I examine the mysterious door", "💰 I ask the merchant about the strange artifact"] }
  generate_node_edition: |
    {think_mode}
    # TASK:
    Based on the following game state and story, update the game graph by specifying creations, deletions, and targeted updates for nodes to match the current state of the story.
    Your output MUST be in JSON format.

    ## Node Properties Reference (for context on available fields):
    - id: Unique id string (cannot be changed by an update operation; new nodes get new IDs)
    - name: string (title)
    - longDescription: string (Mandatory. Player-visible description, markdown format.)
    - type: string (Category/type. Encouraged: 'assistant', 'image-generation', 'system', 'character', 'location', 'event', 'item', 'object', 'mechanic', 'concept', 'library')
    - updateImage: boolean (Set to true on a node if its image needs to be regenerated by the game engine.)

    {utils.wrappers.nodes_description}

    {utils.wrappers.formatted_chat_history}
    
    {utils.wrappers.last_moxus_report_section}

    {utils.wrappers.user_input}

    # RETURN FORMAT (JSON):
    Return a JSON object with three optional top-level keys: "n_nodes", "u_nodes", and "d_nodes".

    1.  **n_nodes**: (Optional) An array of new node objects to be created.
        - IMPORTANT: ONLY create new nodes for entities EXPLICITLY mentioned in the chat history but not yet represented in the game state.
        - DO NOT invent new characters, items, locations, or concepts that weren't directly mentioned in the chat.
        - Each node object must have a new unique "id", "name", "longDescription", "type".
        - Set "updateImage": true if the new node needs an image generated.
        Example (JSON):
        ```json
        "n_nodes": [
          {
            "id": "unique-new-id-001",
            "name": "Mysterious Orb",
            "longDescription": "A faintly glowing orb pulses with an inner light.",
            "type": "item",
            "updateImage": true
          }
        ]
        ```

    2.  **u_nodes**: (Optional) An object where each key is an existing nodeId to be modified. The value is an object specifying the fields to update.
        - For each field on a node (e.g., "name", "longDescription", "type", "image"):
          - To replace the entire field: use `"rpl": "new complete value"`.
            Example: `"name": { "rpl": "The Ancient Tome" }`
          - For small, targeted changes in `longDescription` (to save tokens): use `"df"` followed by an array of diff instructions.
            - Each diff instruction: `{ "prev_txt": "text to find", "next_txt": "text to replace with", "occ": 1 }`
            - `prev_txt`: The exact text fragment to find.
            - `next_txt`: Text to replace `prev_txt`. If empty, `prev_txt` is deleted.
            - `occ`: (Optional, defaults to 1) Which instance of `prev_txt`.
        - To signal image regeneration for a node, include `"img_upd": true` at the level of the node ID.
        - You may add subtle hooks or potential story elements to existing nodes, but keep them minimal and directly related to the current story context.

        Example of `u_nodes` block (JSON):
        ```json
        "u_nodes": {
          "node-id-abc": {
            "name": { "rpl": "The Guard Captain" },
            "longDescription": {
              "df": [
                {
                  "prev_txt": "He looks tired.",
                  "next_txt": "He looks battle-weary but vigilant."
                },
                {
                  "prev_txt": "a simple sword",
                  "next_txt": "a gleaming longsword"
                }
              ]
            },
            "img_upd": true
          },
          "node-id-xyz": {
            "type": { "rpl": "Key Item" },
            "img_upd": false
          }
        }
        ```

    3.  **d_nodes**: (Optional) An array of nodeId strings for nodes to be deleted.
        Example (JSON):
        ```json
        "d_nodes": ["node-id-to-remove-1", "node-id-to-remove-2"]
        ```

    ## Overall JSON structure example:
    ```json
    {
      "n_nodes": [
        {
          "id": "ng01",
          "name": "New Item",
          "longDescription": "line1\nline2\n...",
          "type": "item",
          "updateImage": true
        }
      ],
      "u_nodes": {
        "existingNode01": {
          "longDescription": {
            "df": [
              { "prev_txt": "is old", "next_txt": "is ancient and powerful" }
            ]
          },
          "img_upd": true
        },
        "existingNode02": {
          "name": { "rpl": "A New Name For Node 02" }
        }
      },
      "d_nodes": ["obsoleteNode03"]
    }
    ```

    ## Example longDescription fields values:
    ### Example 1:
    The hoodie shimmered with runes that glowed faintly blue whenever its wearer was in danger.
    Its fabric was unnaturally warm, keeping out even the bitter cold of mountain peaks without being stifling in summer heat.
    The hood, when pulled up, rendered the wearer's face in shadow so deep that not even the keenest eyes could make out their features.

    ### Example 2:
    Her hair was the color of autumn leaves, wild and untamed, falling past her shoulders in waves that seemed to catch fire in the late afternoon sun.
    Her hands were calloused from years of swordplay, at odds with the delicate freckles scattered across her nose and cheeks like constellations.
    When she smiled, which was rarely, it transformed her severe face into something beautiful and dangerous all at once.

    ### Example 3:
    The library stood at the heart of the abandoned monastery, its shelves still lined with leather-bound tomes that had somehow survived the decades of neglect.
    Dust motes danced in the shafts of colored light that fell through the stained-glass windows, painting patterns on the stone floor worn smooth by generations of shuffling feet.
    The air was thick with the smell of old parchment and secrets, whispering to those who knew how to listen.

    ## General Guidelines:
    - Output valid JSON. Syntax is critical.
    - For small textual changes in `longDescription`, use the `df` array within the `u_nodes` block.
    - For other field updates or complete rewrites of `longDescription`, use the `rpl` key.
    - IMPORTANT: Create new nodes (n_nodes) ONLY for entities explicitly mentioned in the chat history but not yet represented in the game state.
    - You can update up to 2 existing nodes, and delete nodes as needed if they haven't been used in the recent history (past 5 interactions).
    - In updates (u_nodes), stick closely to information from the chat history, with only minimal embellishment or minor hooks for future story development.
    - Only track what actually appears in the chat history - DO NOT invent major new plot elements, characters, or items.
    - Keep the node length below 4 paragraphs.
    - Delete nodes when the item is consumed, used or destroyed. For example when a potion is drunk.
    - Perform cleanup on the nodes when you add or update content to avoid adding bloat and making them larger.

    ## IMAGE UPDATE GUIDELINES (CRITICAL - READ CAREFULLY):
    **DEFAULT: DO NOT UPDATE IMAGES** unless there is a compelling visual reason.
    
    **ONLY set `updateImage: true` or `img_upd: true` when there are MAJOR visual changes that would make the current image completely inaccurate:**
    
    ### When TO update images:
    - **Physical transformation**: Character becomes a different species, age dramatically changes, major body modifications
    - **Complete outfit change**: From peasant clothes to royal armor, from modern clothes to medieval robes
    - **Major environmental changes**: Location changes from forest to desert, from intact to ruins
    - **Fundamental state changes**: Item becomes magical and glows, character becomes undead, location becomes corrupted
    - **New visual elements that dominate**: Character gains prominent scars, tattoos, or prosthetics that define their appearance
    
    **Remember**:
    - Image generation is expensive and time-consuming. Only update when the visual change is so significant that someone looking at the current image would say "this doesn't match the description anymore."
    - Each node should be multiple paragraphs long, but avoid having very long ones.
    - The nodes are there for the memory, but shouldn't duplicate the chat history. Write the state of thing there, but never "Character X did Y and is now Z". Instead, specify "Character X is Z" using the same templating
      as the node already uses.

    Return only the JSON object as your entire response, with no additional text or formatting.
  generate_nodes_from_prompt: |
    You are a Game Engine. The user asked to update how the game work or to change some aspect of the world.
    Your task is to update the game nodes based on the following prompt, for a Game Engine:
    {utils.wrappers.user_prompt}
    
    {utils.wrappers.moxus_context_string}

    {utils.wrappers.nodes_description}

    IMPORTANT: When updating nodes, you must follow these critical rules:
    1. NEVER reference or assume knowledge of the previous state of a node. Each node update is a complete replacement.
    2. You must explicitly include ALL content you want to preserve in the updated node. Any content not included will be lost.
    3. Each node update should be self-contained and complete, with no dependencies on previous states.
    4. If you want to keep any information from the previous state, you must explicitly copy it into the new node.
    5. If there are instructions about "merging multiple nodes together", choose one of the existing node to update, and delete the others.
    6. A node is worthy to exist only if it contains at least a full paragraph, otherwise another node should cover its content. For example for room containing lot of object, the objects should be stored in the "room" node if they aren't too detailled each. Or use a "hand of cards" node for a deck related node-graph instead of each card separately.
    7. Maintain one or few nodes for the global game systems, trying not to disseminate game rules into too many nodes. If multiple node, each should focus on a concept, but at least one node should summarize all the game systems and serve as a high-level reference.
    8. Do not update the image_generation type nodes unless explicitely mentionned.
    9. All node should represent a game system, a lore entry, character, or an object. These should NOT be used to describe events or time-limited things. If a specific event need to be remembered, store it in a "memory" game system node.
    10. Encourage the use of the following node types: 'assistant', 'image-generation', 'system', 'character', 'location', 'event', 'item', 'object', 'mechanic', 'concept', 'library'.
    11. The nodes are for the Narrative AI to read, and the user can see their names. You are allowed to include hidden informations in the nodes.

    # RETURN FORMAT (JSON):
    Return a JSON object with three optional top-level keys: "n_nodes", "u_nodes", and "d_nodes".

    1. **n_nodes**: (Optional) An array of new node objects to be created.
       - Each node object must have a new unique "id", "name", "longDescription", "type".
       - Set "updateImage": true if the new node needs an image generated.
       Example (JSON):
       ```json
       "n_nodes": [
         {
           "id": "unique-new-id-001",
           "name": "Mysterious Orb",
           "longDescription": "A faintly glowing orb pulses with an inner light.",
           "type": "item",
           "updateImage": true
         }
       ]
       ```

    2. **u_nodes**: (Optional) An object where each key is an existing nodeId to be modified. The value is an object specifying the fields to update.
       - For each field on a node (e.g., "name", "longDescription", "type"):
         - To replace the entire field: use `"rpl": "new complete value"`.
           Example: `"name": { "rpl": "The Ancient Tome" }`
         - For small, targeted changes in `longDescription` (to save tokens): use `"df"` followed by an array of diff instructions.
           - Each diff instruction: `{ "prev_txt": "text to find", "next_txt": "text to replace with", "occ": 1 }`
           - `prev_txt`: The exact text fragment to find.
           - `next_txt`: Text to replace `prev_txt`. If empty, `prev_txt` is deleted.
           - `occ`: (Optional, defaults to 1) Which instance of `prev_txt`.
       - To signal image regeneration for a node, include `"img_upd": true` at the level of the node ID.

       Example of `u_nodes` block (JSON):
       ```json
       "u_nodes": {
         "node-id-abc": {
           "name": { "rpl": "The Guard Captain" },
           "longDescription": {
             "df": [
               {
                 "prev_txt": "He looks tired.",
                 "next_txt": "He looks battle-weary but vigilant."
               },
               {
                 "prev_txt": "a simple sword",
                 "next_txt": "a gleaming longsword"
               }
             ]
           },
           "img_upd": true
         },
         "node-id-xyz": {
           "type": { "rpl": "Key Item" },
           "img_upd": false
         }
       }
       ```

    3. **d_nodes**: (Optional) An array of nodeId strings for nodes to be deleted.
       Example (JSON):
       ```json
       "d_nodes": ["node-id-to-remove-1", "node-id-to-remove-2"]
       ```

    ## Overall JSON structure example:
    ```json
    {
      "n_nodes": [
        {
          "id": "ng01",
          "name": "New Item",
          "longDescription": "line1\nline2\n...",
          "type": "item",
          "updateImage": true
        }
      ],
      "u_nodes": {
        "existingNode01": {
          "longDescription": {
            "df": [
              { "prev_txt": "is old", "next_txt": "is ancient and powerful" }
            ]
          },
          "img_upd": true
        },
        "existingNode02": {
          "name": { "rpl": "A New Name For Node 02" }
        }
      },
      "d_nodes": ["obsoleteNode03"]
    }
    ```

    Return only the JSON object as your entire response, with no additional text or formatting.
    {utils.diffPrompt}
  sort_nodes_by_relevance: |
    # TASK:
    You are a Game Engine. Your task is to sort the nodes by their relevance to the current chat history.
    Consider both the content of the nodes and the context of the conversation.

    {utils.wrappers.string_history}
    
    {utils.wrappers.last_moxus_report_section}

    ## Nodes to Sort:
    {utils.wrappers.nodes_description}

    Return a JSON object with a single field "sortedIds" containing an array of node IDs in order of relevance (most relevant first).
    Each ID entry in the array should be enclosed in quotes.

    Example response:
    {
      "sortedIds": ["node1", "node2", "node3"]
    }

    Your focus is to order the nodes to sort them, from the most related to the chatHistory, to the least. This will be used to have the Story Generation AI focus on the first.
    For example, the main character and active characters should be first, then the location, then ongoing game systems, ... 

  refocus_story: |
    # TASK:
    The story generation has become inconsistent or of low quality. Your task is to help refocus the narrative.
    You will generate a concise summary of the story so far, followed by an introduction to the current scene.
    This output will replace the current chat history to provide a fresh start.

    # WRITING EXAMPLES (Mimic this style and quality):

    ## Example 1 (Summary Style):
    The adventurers had navigated the treacherous Shadowfen, narrowly escaping the clutches of the bog witches. They discovered a hidden altar revealing a prophecy about the Sunstone, an artifact capable of dispelling the encroaching darkness. Their journey then led them to the city of Veridia, where they learned the Sunstone was last seen in the Obsidian Peaks, guarded by ancient constructs. Sir Kael, the stoic warrior, was driven by a personal vow to protect his homeland, while Elara, the nimble rogue, sought redemption for a past misdeed. Their wizard companion, Fendrel, hoped the Sunstone's magic could restore his lost familiar.

    ## Example 2 (Scene Introduction Style):
    The biting wind whipped at their cloaks as they stood at the precipice of the Obsidian Peaks. Jagged, black spires clawed at the bruised sky, and a palpable sense of ancient power emanated from the mountains. Below them, a narrow, treacherous path snaked its way upwards, disappearing into the swirling mists that clung to the higher slopes. The air was thin and cold, and the silence was broken only by the mournful cry of an unseen bird of prey.

    # INSTRUCTIONS:
    1.  Read the provided chat history.
    2.  Generate a summary of the main story plot points and character motivations from the chat history. This summary should be approximately 4 paragraphs long.
    3.  After the summary, write 1 paragraph that re-introduces the current scene, characters present, and immediate situation, based on the very latest events in chat history.
    4.  Your entire output should be narrative text. Do not include any headings, meta-comments, or apologies.

    {utils.wrappers.past_chat_history}

    {utils.wrappers.nodes_description}

    # RETURN FORMAT:
    Return a single block of text containing the 4-paragraph summary and the 1-paragraph scene introduction.

    # GAME CONTENT PLANNING INSTRUCTIONS
    **YOU ARE**: The Planning Module for Advanced Node Generation. Your task is to analyze the game context and user request to create inputs for subsequent pipeline stages.

    ## INPUT CONTEXT
    {utils.wrappers.nodes_description}

    {utils.wrappers.moxus_context_string}
    
    {utils.wrappers.user_prompt}
    
    {utils.wrappers.string_history}

    ## PLANNING OBJECTIVES
    1. **Identify Target Nodes**: Select nodes requiring modification referenced in chat history or user request
    2. **Plan New Node Creation**: Specify new nodes to create when existing nodes don't cover the requirements
    3. **Plan Node Deletion**: Identify nodes to remove when they're obsolete, conflicting, or requested for removal
    4. **Define Measurable Success Rules**: Create testable boolean requirements per node (existing and new)
    5. **Generate Search Queries**: Craft two distinct queries for web research

    ## OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS (STRICT JSON)
    ```json
    {
      "targetNodeIds": ["existingNodeID1", "NEW_NODE_merchantKael", "NEW_NODE_magicSword"],
      "deleteNodeIds": ["obsoleteNode1", "conflictingNode2"],
      "objectives": "Concise paragraph describing update goals",
      "successRules": [
        "Measurable rule 1 (true/false verifiable)",
        "Rule 2 with clear pass/fail conditions"
      ],
      "searchQueries": [
        "Broad conceptual search (e.g.: RPG character motivation examples)",
        "Specific example search (e.g.: Divinity: Original Sin 2 companion quest structures)"
      ]
    }
    ```

    Note that "targetNodeIds" contain the nodes to edit, and "deleteNodeIds" contain the nodes to delete. It is impossible to have the same node in both lists.

    ## TARGET NODE ID FORMAT
    - **Existing nodes**: Use actual node IDs from the provided game state
    - **New nodes**: Use format "NEW_NODE_descriptiveName" where descriptiveName describes the node (NEW_NODE_merchantKael, NEW_NODE_magicSword, etc.)
    - **Mixed approach**: You can combine both existing node edits and new node creation in the same plan

    ## NODE DELETION GUIDELINES
    - **deleteNodeIds**: Only include existing node IDs that should be removed
    - **Common deletion scenarios**:
      - User explicitly requests removal ("delete the old tavern", "remove this character")
      - Nodes become obsolete after story progression
      - Duplicate or conflicting content that needs cleanup
      - Placeholder nodes that should be replaced by better versions
    - **Never delete**: Core game mechanics, essential locations, or main characters unless explicitly requested
    - **Empty array allowed**: Use `"deleteNodeIds": []` if no deletions are needed

    ## SUCCESS RULES CRITERIA
    Create 3-5 verifiable boolean rules per node type, examples:
    ```
    Character nodes must include:
    ✓ Min. 2 new interaction hooks
    ✓ Unique character not matching existing NPCs
    ✓ Backstory alignment with world lore

    Location nodes require:
    ✓ 2+ interactable objects
    ✓ Clear navigation landmarks
    ```

    ## QUERY GUIDELINES
    1. **BROAD QUERY**: Conceptual inspiration (domain knowledge)
    2. **PRECISE QUERY**: Specific implementation examples (proven designs)

    ## PROHIBITED ACTIONS
    ❌ Do NOT generate node content (handled later)
    ❌ Never reference previous node versions
    ❌ Eliminate subjective terms ("better", "improved")

    ## VALIDATION PROCEDURE
    Your output must pass:
    1. `JSON.parse()` validation
    2. Exactly 2 search queries
    3. Boolean-testable success rules
    4. Node IDs exist in current game

    **YOU MUST RETURN PURE JSON - NO MARKDOWN OR EXPLANATIONS**

    - Choose appropriate node type from: 'assistant', 'image-generation', 'system', 'character', 'location', 'event', 'item', 'object', 'mechanic', 'concept', 'library'
    - Output the complete node directly WITHOUT using diff format

    ### IF OPERATION TYPE = "EDIT_EXISTING_NODE":
    - Update the existing node using diff format
    - Preserve existing content that remains valid
    - Apply targeted changes based on success rules and objectives
    - Do not "convert" the node to a different one. There will be multiple steps. Your task is to update the current node, not override it.

    ## OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS
    **For NEW NODES - Return complete single node (NO diff logic):**
    ```json
    {
      "id": "descriptive-permanent-id",
      "name": "Node Name",
      "longDescription": "Complete detailed description...",
      "type": "character",
      "updateImage": true
    }
    ```

    **For EXISTING NODES - Use diff syntax:**
    {utils.diffPrompt}

    ## MANDATORY CONSTRAINTS
    1. **Rule Compliance**: Address every success rule explicitly in output
    2. **Content Preservation**: (For edits) Maintain existing valid content not contradicted by updates
    3. **Failure Recovery**: Prioritize fixes for previous unmet rules first
    4. **Semantic Integrity**: Ensure updated content logically flows as whole
    5. **New Node Quality**: (For creation) Ensure rich, detailed content worthy of its own node

    ## GENERATION GUIDELINES
    ```mermaid
    flowchart TD
      A[Parse Current Node] --> B[Identify Preserved Sections]
      B --> C[Integrate Search Insights]
      C --> D[Implement Objective Changes]
      D --> E[Validate Against Rules]
      E --> F[Format as Diff Updates]
    ```

    ## PROHIBITED ACTIONS
    ❌ Do NOT create new node sections unless required by objectives
    ❌ Never discard valid existing content to meet new rules
    ❌ Avoid duplicate content from other nodes

    ## OUTPUT VALIDATION
    Before returning, verify:
    ✓ All success rules are satisfied if we apply the output diff
    ✓ Diff actions are minimal and precise, but can be wordy if required.
    ✓ Update consistency with other nodes of same type

    **Return ONLY valid JSON diff object with NO explanatory text**

    # NODE UPDATE VALIDATION INSTRUCTIONS
    **YOU ARE**: The Rule Compliance Verifier for Advanced Node Generation. Your task is to objectively evaluate updated nodes against predefined success criteria.

    ## INPUT CONTEXT
    {utils.wrappers.nodes_description}

    - EDITED NODES (with proposed changes):
    {edited_nodes}

    - ORIGINAL SUCCESS RULES (from Planning Stage):
    {successRules}

    {utils.wrappers.string_history}

    ## OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS (STRICT JSON)
    ```json
    {
      "validatedRules": ["exact rule text from planning that passed", "another exact rule text that passed"],
      "failedRules": [
        {
          "rule": "exact rule text from planning",
          "reason": "specific failure explanation",
          "nodeId": "failed-node-id"
        }
      ],
      "failedNodeIds": ["node-id-1", "node-id-2"]
    }
    ```

    ## VALIDATION PROTOCOL
    1. **Rule Verification**: For each success rule:
      - Check ALL affected nodes
      - Return boolean pass/fail with concrete evidence
      - Flag partial compliance (e.g., "1/2 required hooks present")
      - **CRITICAL**: Use the EXACT rule text from planning in both `validatedRules` and `failedRules.rule`

    2. **Cross-Node Checks**:
      - Detect content overlaps with other nodes
      - Verify node syntax compliance (reference 'game systems' node)
      - Ensure no duplicate functionality exists

    3. **Diff Implementation Check**:
      - Verify proposed changes don't break node integrity
      - Confirm diff will apply correctly

    ## EVALUATION CRITERIA
    ```mermaid
    flowchart LR
      A[Check Rule-Specific Metrics] --> B[Verify Node Syntax]
      B --> C[Scan For Content Overlaps]
      C --> D[Assess Implementation Quality]
      D --> E[Generate Failure Reasons]
    ```

    ## FAILURE REASON GUIDELINES
    For each failed rule, provide:
    - Exact text from rule definition
    - Specific node where failure occurred
    - Quantifiable deficiency (e.g., "Found 1/2 required quest hooks")
    - Reference to conflicting content if applicable

    ## PROHIBITED ACTIONS
    ❌ Do NOT suggest improvements
    ❌ Avoid subjective judgments ("better/worse")
    ❌ Never validate rules not in original successRules

    ## VALIDATION CHECKLIST
    Before output, confirm:
    ✓ Every original success rule appears in either validatedRules or failedRules
    ✓ Each failed rule has corresponding nodeId
    ✓ failedNodeIds contains ALL nodes with unmet rules
    ✓ **CRITICAL**: validatedRules contains EXACT rule text, NOT generic IDs like "rule-id-1"

    **RETURN ONLY VALID JSON - NO ADDITIONAL COMMENTS**

    ## Diff Format Instructions
    
    When updating content, use this diff format:
    
    ### For complete replacement:
    ```json
    {
      "rpl": "Complete replacement text for the entire content"
    }
    ```
    
    ### For targeted updates:
    ```json
    {
      "df": [
        {
          "prev_txt": "exact text to find and replace",
          "next_txt": "new text to replace with",
          "occ": 1
        }
      ]
    }
    ```
    
    ### Diff Instructions:
    - **rpl**: Complete replacement of the entire content
    - **df**: Array of targeted replacements where:
      - `prev_txt`: Exact text fragment to find (case-sensitive)
      - `next_txt`: Text to replace with (can be empty to delete)
      - `occ`: Which occurrence to replace (defaults to 1)
    - **To append new content**: Use `prev_txt: ""` and `next_txt: "\n\nNew content"`

    You should very rarely append new content. When possible, do targeted replacements being careful not to have duplicate content.
    You should take into consideration the final result that will be made with your diff update and not focus on only what you have to add.
