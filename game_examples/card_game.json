        "- **Diffuse Reflection:** Scattered light on matte surfaces.",
        "- **Fresnel Effect:** Increased reflectivity at grazing angles.",
        "- **Microsurface Detail:** Fine texture variations affecting light interaction.",
        "",
        "### Composition Techniques:",
        "- **Rule of Thirds:** Dividing the frame into thirds for balanced composition.",
        "- **Leading Lines:** Using elements to guide the viewer's eye.",

        "## 🔹 Common Pitfalls to Avoid",
        "1. **Overly Symmetrical Compositions:** Creates static, uninteresting images.",
        "2. **Flat Lighting:** Lacks depth and dimension.",
        "3. **Unrealistic Proportions:** Breaks immersion and believability.",
        "4. **Excessive Glow Effects:** Can look artificial and dated.",
        "5. **Poor Material Differentiation:** All surfaces look the same.",
        "6. **Inconsistent Lighting:** Multiple light sources without clear hierarchy.",
        "7. **Overly Busy Backgrounds:** Distracts from the main subject.",
        "8. **Lack of Atmospheric Perspective:** Foreground and background lack depth separation.",
